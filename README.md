### Hey Everyone ðŸ‘‹ 

:house_with_garden: My name is Kathrin, Iâ€™m 39 from GÃ¶rlitz, the eastern-most city in Germany. I live in Dresden since 2009.

:woman_scientist: Iâ€™ve got a Diploma in applied natural sciences and have worked for many years at the interface of molecular biology, plant genomics, and bioinformatics. 

:computer: In 2013 I started to learn Python with MOOCs and two years later I finished my first course on R. 

:hammer_and_wrench: I love coding and I actually enjoy bug fixing as much as spell checking.

:books: As I love to work with data, Iâ€™m attending the neuefische bootcamp on data science.

:jigsaw: Besides Python and scientific riddles, I love photography, board games, speaking Italian, and travelling â€“ but with an almost 2 year old son :family_man_woman_boy:, there is little time for hobbies :smile:
